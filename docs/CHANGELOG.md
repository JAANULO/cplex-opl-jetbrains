# CPLEX-Plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.9.6] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Compatibility:** Replaced deprecated API (`SystemInfo.getOsNameAndVersion`) and internal API (`PluginManagerCore.getPlugin`) to comply with JetBrains Plugin Verifier requirements.

## [1.4.9.5] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **Run Configuration:** Added `ExecutionMode` option to support remote execution environments via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Docker containers, featuring automatic path translation.
- **Bug Reporter:** Added collection of environment data (IDE version, plugin version, OS) for auto-generated error reports on GitHub.

### Changed
- **Plugin Metadata:** Migrated plugin description from `plugin.xml` to `docs/DESCRIPTION.md` generated dynamically in Gradle.

### Fixed
- **Compatibility:** Eliminated a critical class validation error (`NoSuchFieldError` caused by Kotlin compiler specification on older JetBrains installations) for the Marketplace component by using safe Java Reflection in the `OplErrorReportSubmitter` module.
- **Console Filters:** Optimized `OplInfeasibilityFilter` and `OplLinkFilter` to prevent catastrophic backtracking and drastically improve processing speed on extremely long console output lines.
- **Code Quality:** Resolved Qodana warnings by standardizing sentence capitalization in UI string properties and migrating to `Enum.entries` in Kotlin.

## [1.4.9.4] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Language Parser:** Added syntax parsing support for piecewise linear function declarations (`pwlFunction`).
- **Localization (i18n):** Extracted hardcoded English strings into a central `OplBundle.properties` resource bundle.

### Changed
- **Localization (i18n):** Migrated Run Configurations, Settings, Error Reporter, and Code Completion features to use `DynamicBundle` for dynamic UI string loading.

## [1.4.9.3] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Settings:** Added manual "Auto-detect" button in plugin settings for on-demand solver path discovery.
- **Python Integration:** Documented `GeneratePythonRunnerAction` feature for generating executable `doopl` Python scripts with automatic `.dat` file detection.
- **Navigation & References:** Enhanced `OplReference` with scope-aware hierarchical resolution, prioritizing local loop/aggregation iterators (`forall`, `sum`) before searching global declarations (`dvar`, `var`, `dexpr`, `tuple`, `piecewise`, `constraint`).

### Fixed
- **Rating Links:** Updated JetBrains Marketplace review URLs in `OplRateAction` and `OplRatePrompt` to point directly to the plugin reviews page.
- **Documentation:** Synchronized all documentation files under `/docs` with current codebase state and English user-facing UI requirements.

## [1.4.9.2] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Console Filters:** Added `OplFileResolver` with ConcurrentHashMap caching to map temporary execution files (`_temp_...`) back to project workspace files.
- **Error Reporting:** Added `OplErrorReportSubmitter` integration to allow users to report unhandled plugin exceptions directly as pre-filled GitHub Issues.
- **Rating:** Added `OplRateAction` (`Help -> Rate CPLEX OPL Plugin...`) and `OplRatePrompt` notification balloon after 5 successful runs linking to JetBrains Marketplace.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Added automated unit tests for `OplErrorReportSubmitterTest` and expanded `OplRunConfigurationTest` and `OplConsoleFilterTest`.

### Fixed
- **Localization:** Translated all remaining Polish console hint and UI strings to English.

## [1.4.9.1] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Run Configuration:** Added timeout (watchdog) setting to gracefully kill the `oplrun` process if it exceeds the specified time limit.
- **Run Configuration:** Added an input field for additional CLI arguments (e.g., `-tune`).
- **Run Configuration:** Added a checkbox to enable the Conflict Refiner (`-conflict`).
- **Console Filters:** Added `OplInfeasibilityFilter` to intelligently parse CPLEX infeasibility logs (`ctInfeasible at ...`) and create clickable links directly to the conflicting constraints in `.mod` and `.dat` files.
- **Console Filters:** Added a proactive hint for `<<< no solution` output, advising users to enable the Conflict Refiner and name their constraints.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Added automated unit tests for `CplexPathFinder`, `OplSettingsConfigurable`, `OplSettingsState`, and `OplLinkFilter`.
- **Performance:** Added a benchmark test `OplConsoleFilterPerformanceTest` for evaluating processing speed on 100,000 console log lines.
- **Performance & Test Suite:** Added `OplTestSuite` to execute all test classes in a single IDE sandbox instance (~68% speedup) and optimized Gradle parallelism, G1GC, and GrammarKit incremental caching.

### Fixed
- **Run Configuration:** Restored missing XXE attack protection in `.ops` settings file parser.
- **Console Filters:** Added `.trim()` and VFS refresh to `OplLinkFilter` to ensure error line links resolve correctly when preceded by whitespace.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Language Parser:** Added full support in the lexer and grammar for the `key` modifier in tuples and the logical implication operator `=>`.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Language Parser:** Added full support for Constraint Programming (`using CP;`, `dexpr`, `size`, `in all`).
- **Language Parser:** Added support for signed numeric types (`float+`, `int+`), chained inequalities (`1 <= u[i] <= n`), and multi-iterator loops (`i, j in Cities`).
- **Annotator:** Added CP built-in functions (`endOf`, `noOverlap`, etc.) to static analyzer built-ins and fixed `dvar` declaration identifier resolution.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Language Parser:** Added `main` keyword and `main { ... }` block syntax parsing support.

### Changed
- **Language Parser:** Relaxed tuple declaration requirements (semicolon is now optional).
- **Testing:** Consolidated `testData/` directories. Tiny test files for code completion, formatting, commenter, live templates, references, and structure view were inlined directly into Kotlin test classes, reducing repository clutter for cross-device development.
- **Testing:** Consolidated all highlighting tests into a single `highlighting_tests.mod` file.
- **Run Configuration:** Changed temp model file creation logic to use the system temp directory (`%TMP%` / `java.io.tmpdir`) instead of creating temp files directly inside the project directory.

### Fixed
- **Annotator:** Fixed false positive "Missing semicolon" and "Undefined variable" errors for tuple fields and property access (e.g. `i.weight`).
- **Annotator:** Fixed false positive "Variable is already defined" errors caused by improper resolution of nested type names.
- **Testing:** Fixed LiveTemplates formatting flattening in automated tests.
- **Performance:** Optimized `OplAnnotator` to run more efficiently by using `PsiModificationTracker.MODIFICATION_COUNT` for caching and caching the `hasInterval` check to prevent repetitive heavy file-traversal on every inspection run.
- **Performance:** Moved pip dependency installation execution in `GeneratePythonRunnerAction` to a background pooled thread to prevent UI freezes.
- **Git Tracking:** Removed the generated `gen/` directory from Git tracking and added `gen/` to `.gitignore`.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-07-19
### Added
- **Python Integration:** Added `Generate Python Runner` action to create executable `doopl` scripts for `.mod` files.
- **Python Integration:** Added autocompletion support for `doopl`/`docplex` functions inside Python files.
- **Python Integration:** Added an interactive notification action to install the `doopl` library automatically via PIP.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- **Testing:** Fixed path assertion issue in `testCommandLineConstruction` when running on Unix-based OS (GitHub Actions CI/CD).

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Testing:** Implemented comprehensive automated test suite (Unit Tests, Parsing, Highlighting, Completion, Formatting, Commenter) using IntelliJ Platform Test Framework.
- **IDE Features:** Implemented `Find Usages` for OPL variables and parameters.
- **IDE Features:** Added `Rename Refactoring` (Shift+F6) support for variables, tuples, and constraints.
- **Inspections:** Added real-time CP/MIP semantic inspections (e.g. warning about `min`/`max` nonlinearity, missing `endOf()` in scheduling).
- **Examples:** Created a new `examples/` directory containing sample models (MIP knapsack, CP job-shop scheduling) and a self-contained English demo model (`knapsack_demo.mod`) for JetBrains Marketplace.

### Changed
- **API Modernization:** Migrated action classes (`RunOplModelAction`, `OplCreateFileAction`) to `ActionUpdateThread.BGT` to prevent UI freezes.
- **Architectural Cleanup (Light Services):** Migrated `OplSettingsState` to a modern JetBrains Light Service (`@Service`) to improve IDE startup time and dynamic loading support.
- **Language Parser:** Split the compound token `subject to` into two distinct tokens (`SUBJECT` and `TO`). This ensures proper spacing and indentation tolerance (e.g. multiple spaces or newlines) and resolves syntax parsing failures.

### Fixed
- **Qodana & Settings:** Translated settings strings to English and corrected path exclusions for generated parser/lexer files to resolve Qodana warnings.
- **Performance:** Optimized `OplAnnotator` variable scope checks using `CachedValuesManager` to cache declarations, reducing complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ and preventing UI lags on large `.mod` files.
- **Windows Support:** Standardized file path separators in `OplLinkFilter` to ensure clickable console links work correctly on Windows systems.
## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Compatibility:** Lowered minimum required IDE version to 2024.3 (build 243) to support older IDE installations.

### Fixed
- **Formatter:** Fixed indentation logic in `OplBlock` to correctly indent nested structures within constraint blocks.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **PyCharm Compatibility:** Added missing `com.intellij.modules.lang` dependency to `plugin.xml` to fix installation issues in PyCharm and other JetBrains IDEs.
- **File Icons:** Added `icon=` attributes to `fileType` definitions in `plugin.xml` to enforce rendering of dedicated SVG icons for `.mod` and `.dat` files.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **File Templates:** Added "New -> OPL File" action to generate `.mod` and `.dat` files from templates.

- **Operators:** Added lexer/parser support for `==`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, and `%`.
- **Array Literals:** Added grammar support for bracketed array literals in expressions.

### Fixed

- **Greedy Lexer Bug:** Fixed lexer rules for minus signs and variables (e.g., `r-1` without spaces) preventing false syntax errors.
- **Parser Completeness:** Added missing `==` (double equals) operator to the Lexer and Parser.
- **Formatter:** Added spacing for `==` and `!=`, plus improved indentation in constraint/execute blocks and nested loops.
- **Annotator:** Skip `execute` blocks and improve iterator scope checks to avoid false errors.
